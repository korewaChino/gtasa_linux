<h1 align=center>GTA: San Andreas - Nintendo Switch port</h1>

This is a wrapper/port of the Android version of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas
(**v2.11.311**, arm64-v8a). It loads the original game binary, patches it and
runs it. It's basically a minimalist Android environment in which we natively
run the original 64-bit Android binary as-is.

### How to install

You're going to need:
* the **arm64-v8a** `.apk` (and `.obb`) for version **2.11.311**.

To install:
1. Create a folder called `gtasa` in the `switch` folder on your SD card.
2. From the **arm64-v8a** APK, extract these two native libraries to
   `/switch/gtasa/`:
   * `lib/arm64-v8a/libGame.so`
   * `lib/arm64-v8a/libc++_shared.so`
3. Extract the **game data** so the files sit loose under `/switch/gtasa/`,
   preserving their directory structure:
   * everything under the APK's `assets/` folder, **and**
   * the contents of the OBB (`main.*.obb` — it is just a ZIP; the `data/`,
     `models/`, `texdb/`, `audio/`, `text/`, `anim/`, `es2/`, … trees inside it
     go directly in `/switch/gtasa/`).
4. Copy `gtasa_nx.nro` into `/switch/gtasa/`.

Your SD card should end up with at least `/switch/gtasa/gtasa_nx.nro`,
`/switch/gtasa/libGame.so`, `/switch/gtasa/libc++_shared.so`, and the extracted
game data folders (`data/`, `models/`, `texdb/`, `audio/`, …) all inside
`/switch/gtasa/`.

### Notes

This will not work in applet/album mode (it needs the full memory + syscall set).
Launch it through a **game override** (hold R on an installed title) or a
forwarder.

Save games and settings are stored in `/switch/gtasa/`.

The port has a config file at `/switch/gtasa/config.txt`, created on first run:
* `screen_width` / `screen_height` — render resolution; `-1` picks 1280x720 in
  handheld and 1920x1080 docked
* `trilinear_filter` — `1` forces trilinear texture filtering
* `show_fps` — `1` draws a small FPS counter in the top-left corner
* `ps2_corona_rotation` — `1` PS2 Corona Sun
* `ps2_color_filter` — `1` PS2 Color filter
* `sprint_any_surface` — `0` Sprinting on any surface is allowed
* `remove_air_resistance` — `0` Remove "ExtraAirResistance" flag
* `show_wanted_stars` — `0` Always drawable wanted stars
* `disable_ped_spec` — `1` Removed specular lighting on pedestrians
* `no_offscreen_despawn` — `0` Cars and peds don't despawn when you look away
* `mobile_widgets` — `0` Hidden Mobile Widgets

### Tips and Tricks

- You can input PC cheats by pressing **R3** + **L3** to open the on-screen keyboard. See [CHEATS.md](CHEATS.md) for available and unavailable cheats (you can input cheat codes in lowercase as well as uppercase).
- Due to expired licensing, some songs were cut from the game. See [MUSIC.md](MUSIC.md) for a list of removed tracks and a guide on how to restore them.
- Console-style HUD (optional). Drop a custom `Adjustable.cfg` into `switch/gtasa/` for the console HUD (e.g. radar in the bottom-left corner). Since **v2.11.311** no longer includes `data/360Default1280x720.cfg`, take it from the older **v2.10** build and rename it to `Adjustable.cfg`. It's a leftover from the Xbox 360 version.
- In order to reduce occasional stutters in-game, delete both `switch/gtasa/scache_small_low.txt` and `switch/gtasa/scache_small.txt`, then create a copy of the `switch/gtasa/scache.txt` file to have two version of it. (for example `scache(1).txt` so in the end you end up with both `scache.txt` and `scache(1).txt` inside the `switch/gtasa/` folder), then rename `scache.txt` to `scache_small.txt` and `scache(1).txt` to `scache_small_low.txt` . This will however make the loading screen longer since it needs to compile more shaders ahead.
  - Mesa stores its persistent single-file shader cache under `switch/gtasa/shadercache/mesa_shader_cache_sf`. Delete that directory only when diagnosing a corrupt cache.

### Mod Settings Menu

The port includes a built-in configurator for toggling the mod's fixes and features.

**To open it:** at launch, a splash screen appears for ~3 seconds
("Hold ZR for Mod Settings"). **Hold ZR** during this window to enter the menu.
If you don't hold ZR, the game boots normally.

### How to build

**1. Install the Switch portlibs:**

```sh
dkp-pacman -S switch-sdl2 switch-mpg123 switch-ffmpeg switch-openal-soft switch-libexpat switch-libzstd switch-zlib
```

**3. Build the `.nro`:**

```sh
make
```
